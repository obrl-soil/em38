Description: Interprets and decodes the '.N38' file format used by the 
    Geonics EM38-MK2 ground conductivity meter, as described in its 
	manual. This package offers an alternative to the existing format conversion 
	software, which lacks a command-line interface and thus cannot be easily 
	used in a reproducible workflow. Note that only a limited subset of the 
	functionality available in the existing software has been replicated.
