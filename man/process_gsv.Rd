\title{Process NMEA-0183 G*GSV messages}
\usage{
process_gsv(string = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{A string with valid NMEA-0183 G*GSV structure.}
}
\value{
A list containing 15 data elements recorded in NMEA-0183 G*GSV data
  chunks. Elements are given appropriate data types. Note that depending on
  the number of satellites in view, up to three of these messages may exist
  for every GPS reading. Up to four satellites are reported on per string.
  Note also that SNR is receiver-dependant and should only be considered
  relative to other readings in the same dataset.
}
\description{
This function pulls out satellites in view data from NMEA-0183 G*GSV strings
and dumps it into a list.
